# Awesome Ghostty

## About Ghostty
[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) is a fast, feature-rich, and cross-platform terminal emulator that uses platform-native UI and GPU acceleration.

Ghostty is a very feature-rich terminal.

Terminal features can be divided into two categories: features for end-users and features for terminal application developers.

Features for end-users are things like multi-window, tabs, splits, ligatures, auto-update, etc. These are features that make using a terminal more pleasant without requiring any changes to the running terminal applications (such as your shell, text editor, etc.).

Features for terminal application developers are things like the Kitty graphics protocol, Kitty keyboard protocol, synchronized rendering, light/dark mode notifications, etc. These features allow terminal applications to do more than they could in other terminal emulators. While these features are not directly used by end-users, end-users benefit from them because terminal applications they use every day can do more.

For a full list of features, visit the [features section](https://ghostty.org/docs/features) in the Ghostty documentation.

## Tools for Ghostty
[Ghostty Config tool ](https://ghostty.zerebos.com/) - an unofficial tool for creating custom Ghostty configurations.
[Ghostty Gost ](https://github.com/gambithunt/ghostty-ghost) - Cli tool to transfer terminal settings from Kitty and Alacritty to Ghostty terminal

## Shaders
One of the unique features of Ghostty is the ability to use custom shaders. This can be used for anything from crazy looks and effects to accessibility features.
